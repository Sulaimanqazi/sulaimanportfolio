        ‎‎ ‎‎ ‎ ‎ ‎‎ ‎ ‎    This semester has been a journey filled with learning valuable information I’ll use throughout my life. We covered a wide range of valuable topics around my career, from learning about what careers would interest me, to learning how to apply for a job. One topic in particular which was most useful was learning how to build a resume. This lesson equipped me with the ability to effectively showcase my skills and past experiences on a paper that would be used by employers. As I searched for jobs recently, I realized the importance of resume building and applied the skills learned in this lesson to multiple job applications. For example, I implemented the tips of limiting our resume to one page only and using a 10-point font size minimum. 
        <br>
        ‎‎ ‎‎ ‎ ‎ ‎‎ ‎ ‎    While I do believe this curriculum supplied me with a great deal of valuable information, one topic I wish we covered would be how to build a LinkedIn profile. In today’s world, LinkedIn pages are essential in acquiring a job and are a valuable tool in many areas. For example, I know of many job opportunities that ask for your LinkedIn profile. Understanding how to optimize my LinkedIn profile and build professional connections I’d be able to prepare myself for these opportunities.
<br>
‎‎ ‎‎ ‎ ‎ ‎‎ ‎ ‎    One of the highlights of the semester was our lesson on how to make a cover letter. Before this lesson, I did not know much about cover letters or their significance. I incorrectly assumed that they were not needed in most instances and that just a resume was enough. With this lesson, I learned its purpose and importance, what to include, and how to format it. I implemented the skills I learned in this lesson on actual cover letters, making tweaks to adjust them to my personal experiences and what the job requires. By doing so, I successfully secured an interview at one organization. 
<br>
‎‎ ‎‎ ‎ ‎ ‎‎ ‎ ‎    In conclusion, this semester has been significant in providing me with career knowledge. The focus on resume building and the lesson on cover letter skills have empowered me to progress more confidently along my career path. Additionally, a lesson regarding the use of LinkedIn would provide a valuable enhancement for future semesters.
